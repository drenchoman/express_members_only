![alt Hacker Club Landing Page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhkbanegq/image/upload/v1642295849/avatars/hacker_home_oajgnv.jpg)

> ## From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/members-only)

> - [live demo](https://hacker-club.herokuapp.com/)

## Assignment
> Create an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the message and wonder who wrote it.

## Learnings
>This project was an opportunity to develop authentication skills and to show unique Views based on User's privileges.

>I now have a clearer understanding of how Authentication works in the Backend and the importance of hashing and salting when storing User passwords. This process is critical for safety and provides a more secure way to store Users passwords incase of a database breach.

>In future projects I want to explore using OAuth authentication methods provided by Passportjs

## Built using
* Node/Express
* Passport JS for local authentication
* Mongodb
* EJS- Views
* Deployed using Heroku
